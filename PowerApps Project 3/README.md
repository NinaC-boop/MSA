## MSA Project 3: NWTPR

A mental illness application that voices reaffirmations for the worries you have.

-----------------------

### Persona
Depressed, 15-year-old high schooler named Jake Bailey who gets bullied at school daily. Doesn’t have friends and is too scared to tell his parents about his loneliness. Visits BeyondBlue and gets low-quality, slow replies that are not empathetic at all.

### Solution
NWTPR would be a free outlet, very relatable and easy for the younger audience due to its beautiful animations (Source: SeerLight), and easy UI - there’s only one main functionality per page, such as typing in a concern in the stark middle of the page, and receiving an affirmation in response. 

It can be personalised, as they can practise their own reaffirmations by adding it in on the top right-hand corner of the page. The automatic response from the system of reaffirmations, feels like the user is engaging with real friends. The responses are immediate and high-quality as it is topic focused. 

If need be, there are also refresh buttons to change the reaffirmations they receive. Main screen pages can be switched in order to receive maximum personalisation and relaxation. The use of phone applications enables even segregated individuals to universally gain access to immediate help, especially in crucial times of breakdowns, and in remote areas.

### Extensibility
The app is only currently 27 MB with its data table being 154 kB. This can be locally saved on the phone, with users adding in their own reaffirmations of around 65 Bytes per affirmation. This means that size would not be a problem in scalability.

However, for further development to varying audiences, AI can be used to assist retrieval and filtration of reaffirmations, such as auto-checking whether the reaffirmation is toxic or positive and filtering it, or personalising it to the user’s previous contexts and demographic. This, which would encase the use of online servers and databases, would be more costly and need a higher development team too.

For economic productivity, sponsorship is recommended from mental illness websites and a donation button would be added seamlessly to the final product. It can be extended to the student market virally through social media platforms such as TikTok, Reddit and Facebook.
